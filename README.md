# DC-DC Buck Converter with EMI/EMC Analysis (LTSpice)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a Buck DC-DC Converter using **LTSpice**.  
The objective is to study:
- Output voltage ripple and EMI.
- Effect of grounding and filtering techniques for signal integrity.

## Features
- Buck converter designed for 20V â†’ 15V @ 5A load.
- Switching frequency: 50 kHz.
- EMI filtering using LC filter.
- Analysis of output ripple before and after EMI filter.

## Tools Used
- LTSpice XVII (circuit simulation)

## Results
- Achieved stable 15V regulated output.
- Ripple voltage reduced from ~120mV using LC filter.

## Applications
- Power supplies in embedded systems.
- Demonstrates **circuit simulation, EMI/EMC analysis**.
